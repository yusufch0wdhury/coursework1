								<p>Being the age of 2 at the time of this trip, I don't remember much of what happened other than what I've seen on video recordings captured on a handheld camcorder. My family and I went to Disneyland Paris, and had a great time. I probably was confined to a pram for most of the time however I'm sure I enjoyed the experience. Apparently I was terrified of the Pluto mascot. Fun.</p>

								<p>This was the first time I had visited the country where my parents are from. My father's brother (who lives in Sylhet) was getting married and so we flew over for the wedding. We spent about a month in the city, where I got to experience what life in Bangladesh is like. Although I did not like the creatures there (such as mosquitoes and cockroaches), I enjoyed the experience overall.</p>

								<p>After being recommended to visit this place countless times, we decided to take a holiday to Dubai, and it most certainly lived up to expectations. The city was beautiful, in both the day and night. We visited a couple of theme parks, went on a cruise, and rode Jeeps on sand dunes. It was great.</p>

									<li>Paris (purely because I don't remember it)</li>
