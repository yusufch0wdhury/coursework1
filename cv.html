									<h3>Experience</h3>
									<p><b>2021 - Present: <i>Retail Staff at Constellation -</i></b> I currently work on a zero-hour basis with an agency called 'Constellation'. My primary location of work is Watford <abbr>FC's</abbr> home stadium, Vicarage Road. I serve food and drink to customers, and often take up the role of team leader. This teaches me how to organise a team both in preparation for a day of work, and also how to maintain such organisation throughout the workday. </p>

									<p><b>2021: <i>Creating a Pomodoro Timer in Java -</i></b> Over the course of the second national lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic, I embarked on completing some personal projects, the highlight being creating a pomodoro timer in Java. It was my first time developing using a Graphical User Interface in the language, so learning how to get buttons working to stop and start the timer was something I was quite proud of. I then proceeded to use my pomodoro timer to help me during my studies, as I like to write programs that will help me in my day-to-day activities.</p>

									<p><b>2015 - Present: <i>General Programming -</i></b> I began programming in an academic setting in 2015, where I worked in Python during my year 7 Computing classes. I then developed this knowledge with Python, alongside learning HTML and CSS in my GCSE Computer Science course. I then moved on to working in Java during my A Level Computer Science Course. Outside of school, I have dabbled in C and C#, while trying out game development.</p>

									<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
									<p>I enjoy going to the gym every week. Most of the time, I go on my own which helps me maintain a schedule as I make sure I am at the gym at the same time every week. When I go with a friend, that helps me stick to deadlines imposed by other people and adapt my schedule around it. Being at the gym at the time my friends want to go helps me to improve my punctuality.</p>
								<p>I also enjoy playing chess. Chess is a game that you can always get better at, and I enjoy it as it helps me to improve my logical and analytical skills, since you need to constantly analyse both you and your opponents moves and try and plan ahead wherever possible, something extremely important in the field of computer science.</p>
								<p>Sports also plays a big role in my life. I enjoy both playing and watching football. Playing football helps to improve my ability to work in teams, as this is necessary in order to win games. I also enjoy watching <abbr>MMA</abbr>.</p>
